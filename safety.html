      <h2>Attila's Tips</h2>
      <p>Make sure to follow all of these guidelines and stay safe while in 
         the kitchen, Attila's Kitchen is not responsible for any damage or injury 
         during the cooking process.</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not put cooked food on an unwashed plate or a cutting board <br> 
            that has had raw food on it. Always put cooked food on a clean plate.</li>
        <li>Use a tissue to cover your mouth and nose for sneezes or coughs, <br>
            and turn away from food while coughing or sneezing. Wash hands right<br>
            away after a cough or sneeze.</li>
        <li>Turn the oven off and unplug all cooking appliances before leaving <br>
            the kitchen. Never leave an oven or stove on or with the door open <br>
            for room heat.</li>
        <li>Keep electrical appliances away from water to avoid shocks. Stay away<br>
            from electrical sockets, especially if your hands are wet, and instruct<br>
            children not to put their fingers or hands anywhere near sockets.</li>
        <li>Always turn pot handles inward toward the back of the stove so they can <br>
            not be reached or pulled down.</li>
        <li>Use a frying screen over pans to prevent grease splattering. If grease<br>
            catches fire, cover the pan with a lid.</li>
        <li>Never add water to a pan that has hot oil in it. It could make the <br>
            oil spatter and burn someone. Throw baking soda or flour on a grease fire</li>
       </ul>
